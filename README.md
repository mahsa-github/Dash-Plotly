About
The Synthetic Sweden Mobility (SySMo) model provides a simplified yet statistically realistic microscopic representation of the real population of Sweden. The agents in this synthetic population contain socioeconomic attributes, household characteristics, and corresponding activity plans for an average weekday. This agent-based modelling approach derives the transportation demand from the agentsâ€™ planned activities using various transport modes (e.g., car, public transport, bike, and walking).

This open data repository contains four datasets: 

(1) Synthetic Agents, 

(2) Activity Plans of the Agents,  

(3) Travel Trajectories of the Agents, and  

(4) Road Network (EPSG: 3006)

(OpenStreetMap data were retrieved on August 28, 2023, from https://download.geofabrik.de/europe.html, and GTFS data were retrieved on September 6, 2023 from https://samtrafiken.se/)

The database can serve as input to assess the potential impacts of new transportation technologies, infrastructure changes, and policy interventions on the mobility patterns of the Swedish population.
